This is a simple boolean calculator that can perform 16 boolean functions with 3 variables.
It does the following operations `

	- Gives boolean functions truth table
	- Finds fictitious variables
	- Deletes fictitious variables (if they exist) and gives thuth table without them
	- Gives function's perfect conjunctive normal form
	- Gives function's perfect disjunctive normal form
	- Gives Zhegalkin's polynomal 

How to use this calculator

Input your function replacing variable names with (x, y, z) and functions with this order `
	
	- for negation (NOT) (¬A) 			use --- (!A) 
	- for conjunction (AND) (A ∧ B) 		use --- (A & B)
	- for disjunction (OR) (A ∨ B)   	   	use --- (A v B)
	- for exclusive dijunction (XOR) (A⊕ B) 	use --- (A ^ B)
	- for Sheffer stroke (NAND) (A | B)		use --- (A | B)
	- for Peirce's arrow (NOR) (A ↓ B) 		use --- (A / B)
	- for equivalence (XNOR) (A ≡ B) 		use --- (A ~ B)
	- for implication (IMP) (A -> B) 		use --- (A -> B)

Priority of operations `

1. NOT
2. AND
3. OR
4. IMP
5. other functions in order of their appearance

The parentheses nullify priority
Puting white spaces is okay.
